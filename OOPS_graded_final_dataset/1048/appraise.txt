1. The `compare` method in the `RunsComparator` class is correctly implemented.

2. The `readPlayersFromFile` method in the `CricketDataHandler` class is correctly implemented.

3. The `writePlayersToFile` method has a critical error in the way it writes player data. It mistakenly writes the `wicketsTaken` value twice instead of writing the `teamName`. This will lead to incorrect data being saved in the output file.

4. The `updatePlayerStats` method is implemented correctly.

5. The `calculateTeamAverageRuns` method does not handle the case where no players from the specified team are found. It should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if `playerNo` remains zero after the loop, to prevent division by zero.

6. The `filter` method in the `TeamFilterStrategy` class is correctly implemented.

7. The `filter` method in the `AllRounderStatsFilter` class compares condition as >= instead of > as decided in rubric.
