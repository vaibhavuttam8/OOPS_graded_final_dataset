2. The `readPlayersFromFile` method in the `CricketDataHandler` class is  correctly implemented.

3. The `writePlayersToFile` method is implemented correctly.

4. The `updatePlayerStats` method is correctly implemented.

5. The `calculateTeamAverageRuns` method has a logical error in the average calculation. The division of `total_runs` by `playersFound` should be cast to `double` to avoid integer division, which could lead to incorrect average values.

6. The `filter` method in the `TeamFilterStrategy` class is correctly implemented.

7. The `filter` method in the `AllRounderStatsFilter` class is correctly implemented. The conditions of Role = "ALL_ROUNDER", minimum runs and wickets are correctly implemented.
