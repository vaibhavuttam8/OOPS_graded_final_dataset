1. The `compare` method in the `RunsComparator` class is correctly implemented, as it returns values as required to sort in descending order.

2. The `readPlayersFromFile` method in the `CricketDataHandler` class is correctly implemented.

3. The `writePlayersToFile` method is correctly implemented.

4. The `updatePlayerStats` method is correctly implemented.

5. The `calculateTeamAverageRuns` method is implemented correctly. It has been ensured that integer division does not occur during average computation by multiplying by '1.0'.

6. The `filter` method in the `TeamFilterStrategy` class is correctly implemented.

7. The `filter` method in the `AllRounderStatsFilter` class is mostly correct but fails to check if the role of the player matches with "ALL_ROUNDER".
