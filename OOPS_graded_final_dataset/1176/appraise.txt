1. The `compare` method in the `RunsComparator` class is correctly implemented.

2. The `readPlayersFromFile` method in the `CricketDataHandler` class fails to check for FileNotFoundException.

3. The `writePlayersToFile` method is correct.

4. The `updatePlayerStats` method is implemented correctly, but the way it throws an `IllegalArgumentException` is not appropriate. Instead of creating a `Throwable` and catching it, it should directly throw the exception when no player matches the given name.

5. The `calculateTeamAverageRuns` method is implemented correctly.

6. The `filter` method in the `TeamFilterStrategy` class is correctly implemented.

7. The `filter` method in the `AllRounderStatsFilter` class fails to check if the player is an 'ALL_ROUNDER'.
