1. The `compare` method in the `RunsComparator` class is correctly implemented to compare players based on their runs scored in descending order. The logic is sound, and it returns the expected values based on the comparison.

2. The `readPlayersFromFile` method is incomplete.  The student has not implemented the logic to skip the first line, split and parse data, or create `Player` objects from the data read. The line `players.add(player);` is incorrect as `player` is not defined in the method. The student also incorrectly returns the lit outside the mthod

3. The `writePlayersToFile` method is also incomplete. The student has not implemented any logic to write player data to the file. The file path provided has incorrect escape sequences (e.g., `C:\Users\user\Desktop\SS_24_25_CBT.txt` should use double backslashes or forward slashes).

4. In the updatePlayerStats method, the variable playername is not defined; it should be playerName. The comparison for matching player names should use .equals() instead of ==, as == only checks reference equality for strings. Additionally, the student incorrectly replaces the wickets instead of adding them; p.setWicketsTaken(wickets) should be p.setWicketsTaken(p.getWicketsTaken() + wickets). Moreover, the logic for throwing an exception is incorrect; the exception should only be thrown if no player matches after checking all players, not within the loop.

5. In the calculateTeamAverageRuns method, the comparison p.getTeamName() == teamName uses == instead of .equals() for string comparison. The count variable is incorrectly incremented with count += count instead of count++, and the totalRuns is not being updated inside the loop.

6. The `filter` method in the `TeamFilterStrategy` class has a similar issue with the comparison of strings. The `==` operator should not be used for string comparison; `equals()` should be used instead. Additionally, the list `p1` should be of type `List<Player>` instead of `ArrayList<String>`.

7. The `filter` method in the `AllRounderStatsFilter` class is not implemented at all, which is a significant omission.
