1. The `compare` method in the `RunsComparator` class is correctly implemented.

2. The `readPlayersFromFile` method hardcodes the file name instead of using the `fileName` parameter, and exception in case file is not found is not handled.

3. Exception in case file is not found is not handled. The format of the output line does not match the expected CSV format (missing commas).

4. The `updatePlayerStats` method has a logical error, the line `int neww = oldw = wickets;` incorrectly assigns `wickets` to `oldw` instead of summing it. It should be int neww = oldw + wickets;

5. The method is correctly implemented.

6. The `filter` method in the `TeamFilterStrategy` class is correctly implemented.

7. The `filter` method in the `AllRounderStatsFilter` class has a syntax error. The condition `Role.valueOf(players.get(i).getRole()).equals("ALL_ROUNDER")` is incorrect because `getRole()` returns an enum, and you should compare it directly to `Role.ALL_ROUNDER`. The method also has a missing closing parenthesis for the `if` statement. Also we are checking the criteria with ==, while it should have been <.
