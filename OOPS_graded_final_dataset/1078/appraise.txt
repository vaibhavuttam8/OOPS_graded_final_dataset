1. The compare method is correctly implemented.

2. The fileName is hardcoded instead of using the argument passed to the method.

3. The `writePlayersToFile` method has a critical error in the loop where it attempts to write player data. The loop condition should be `i < players.size()` instead of `i <= players.size()`, as this will cause an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` when trying to access the last element. Also, the player information is not converted to the CSV format before writing to the file.

4. In the `updatePlayerStats` method, the check for player name equality should use `.equals()` instead of `==`. The current implementation will not correctly identify players with the same name due to reference comparison. Also, the illegalArgumentException should not be thrown in the else block since it will throw the exception even if a player matching the playerName exists but comes after some other player in the list.

5. The implementation is correct.

6. In the `filter` method of `TeamFilterStrategy`, the comparison for team names should also use `.equals()` instead of `==` to ensure proper string comparison.

7. The `filter` method in `AllRounderStatsFilter` has a logical error. It should check if the player is an all-rounder before checking the criteria for runs and wickets. The current implementation does not filter by role.
